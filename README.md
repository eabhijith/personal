# My Personal Portfolio & Resume

Hi there! 👋 Welcome to the repository for my personal website.

I built this site to serve as a live, interactive version of my professional resume. It's designed to give you a quick yet comprehensive overview of my work as a **Senior Systems Architect & AI Specialist**, covering my experience with Agentic AI, Cloud infrastructure, and Salesforce ecosystems.

## 🛠 Under the Hood

While the interface looks like a clean, single-page profile, it's built on a modern stack to ensure it's responsive, maintainable, and print-friendly:

-   **React**: For building a modular and dynamic UI.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, utility-first styling that looks great on any device.
-   **GitHub Pages**: For seamless hosting and deployment directly from this repository.

## 🚀 Running It Locally

If you're curious about the code or want to spin this up on your own machine:

1.  **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eabhijith/personal.git
    cd personal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```

3.  **Start the dev server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## 📄 PDF Version
One cool feature: I've added specific print styles so you can simply hit the **Pdf** button (or `Cmd/Ctrl + P`) to generate a clean, distraction-free PDF version of my resume.
